          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900">Introduction</h2>
          <p>Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) technology is a popular choice for hair removal and skin treatments, but its safety and comfort for darker skin types have long been debated. <strong>Sapphire contact cooling</strong> technology has emerged as a significant advancement, greatly improving the comfort and safety of IPL treatments for a broader range of skin tones. However, not all Fitzpatrick skin types are equally suitable for IPL, even with sapphire cooling.</p>

      {/* What Is Sapphire Cooling? */}

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900">What Is Sapphire Cooling?</h2>
          <p><strong>Sapphire cooling</strong> uses a highly conductive sapphire crystal at the tip of the IPL device. This crystal rapidly absorbs and dissipates heat, keeping the skin surface cool during treatment. The result is a significant reduction in pain, risk of burns, and skin irritation, even at higher IPL energy settings.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">Key Benefits</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Rapid Heat Dissipation:</strong> Maintains a low skin temperature throughout the session.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Cooling:</strong> Provides a constant cooling effect, unlike intermittent cooling methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Comfort:</strong> Users report up to 90% less discomfort compared to non-cooled IPL treatments.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Safety:</strong> Reduces the risk of burns and pigment changes, especially important for darker skin tones.</li>

            <li><strong>Heat Management:</strong> The sapphire absorbs excess heat, protecting the epidermis and minimizing discomfort.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Protection:</strong> The cooling effect persists throughout the session, allowing for higher energy use without increased pain or risk.</li>
