IPL isn't effective on white or grey hair due to lower amounts of melanin, and red hair contains a different type of melanin which isn't responsive to IPL. It is not suitable for use on deep skin tones or skin rich in melanin. It is possible to see results when treating darker blonde hair, but you may need a few extra treatments to get the same standard of hair reduction."},{question:"Is IPL painful?",answer:"Most people describe it as a slight tingling or warm sensation. In recent clinical trials, users rated the discomfort of a IPL treatment at just 3 out of 10. If you are a little sensitive to the treatment at first, we recommend you use Gentle Mode, which can help you get used to the experience."},{question:"How long will it take to see results? Is IPL permanent?",answer:"Most users notice hair reduction between 2-4 weeks. IPL devices will prevent hair regrowth as long as you keep treating it regularly. After the initial 12-week regime, you will need to do 'top up' treatments every 4-8 weeks depending on your hair growth rate. After 12 weeks, you could see up to 99% hair reduction. Remember that results may vary for different people."},{question:"Do I need to wear eye protection when using IPL?",answer:"Our devices have been developed with safety at the forefront and are safe to use without the need for eye protection. However, you should never attempt to fire on to or close to the eye itself."},{question:"How often should I use my IPL?",answer:"To get the most out of your IPL you should start off by using it once a week for 12 weeks continuously. After the initial 12-week, switch to maintenance treatments every 2 to 4 weeks. There is no increased benefit from using your device more than once a week."}]},{title:"Safety & Suitability",icon:j.A,qas:[{question:"Is IPL safe for at-home use?",answer:"Yes. IPL is clinically proven and FDA-cleared for long-term hair reduction when used as directed. Devices filter UV rays and comply with FCC, CE, and RoHS standards."},{question:"Can IPL cause cancer or skin damage?",answer:"No. IPL does not emit harmful UV associated with cancer or long-term damage; filters block those wavelengths."},{question:"Who should not use IPL?",answer:"Children under 18; pregnant or breastfeeding women; individuals with photosensitive conditions, very dark skin, white/grey/red hair, tattoos, or dark moles should avoid IPL."},{question:"Is IPL suitable for all skin and hair types?",answer:"Most effective on light-to-medium skin with dark hair. Less effective on light hair and not recommended for deep skin tones."},{question:"Is IPL safe? Is it safe for my skin?",answer:"Yes. Our devices are FDA cleared and have been clinically proven to be safe and effective, with over 5,500 clinical treatments performed on different skin tones. All our devices feature a skin tone sensor that automatically reads your skin tone before every flash ensuring the device flashes only if safe, so you will never burn your skin. Our devices are compliant with the latest Eye Safety Standards. Your skin is protected by our advanced 3mm glass UV filter which prevents damaging light reaching your skin."},{question:"Can I use IPL if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?",answer:"We don't recommend using IPL if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Our devices have not been tested with these individuals."},{question:"Can I use IPL over my tattoos?",answer:"Do not use IPL over scars or tattoos.

Always complete a patch test before your first treatment."}]},{title:"Usage & Results",icon:k.A,qas:[{question:"Does IPL treatment hurt?",answer:"Most users feel only warmth or mild tingling.

Avoid inner bikini, genitals, anus, and areas above the cheekbones."},{question:"Can I remove hair in between treatments?",answer:"Of course!
